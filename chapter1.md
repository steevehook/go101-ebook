# Chapter 1
## What’s in it for me? Find the motivation to achieve your ambitious life goals.

Today, a vast amount of workers are unmotivated. They go to work not because they want to but because they need the money. The work itself is merely a tedious means to a financial end.

These blinks explore what makes these workers so unmotivated. Often, it’s a matter of false beliefs. We tend to think that certain perks – like a generous paycheck – will be enough to motivate us to work hard. But in the end we realize that other things – like the meaning of the work we do – are far more important.

In these blinks, you’ll learn

- how to work 18 hours a day without getting disillusioned;
- that building a life project is not dissimilar to building a Lego house; and
- why it’s worth putting effort into whatever project you’re involved in.
