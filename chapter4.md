# Chapter 4
## Invested effort and a sense of ownership lead to value.

What do you think would be more gratifying: baking and decorating a fancy cake or making some cupcakes from a packet? For most people, it’s a no-brainer. The more satisfying option is cooking something from scratch. That’s because effort engenders meaning. It’s true of all tasks: the more effort you put in, the more meaning – and thus motivation – you’ll get out of it.

Just take two groups of people who were tasked with folding paper into origami. One group was given very clear instructions for carrying out the project. Directional arrows and written explanations guided them through the step-by-step process of completing the design. Meanwhile, the other group was given minimal and confusing instructions.

Once done with the origami, the participants from the two groups were asked how much they would pay for their creations. According to the author, the participants who were given limited instructions were willing to pay much more for what they’d produced, even though many of their creations didn’t look so good. This indicates that the more effort we put into something, the more value we tend to bestow on it.

So effort plays a major role. Equally motivating is our ability to claim ownership of our work. For instance, after the origami experiment, the folded figures were shown to people who hadn’t been involved in creating them.

These people said they’d be willing to pay maybe $15 for a completed origami figure. Those who had folded them, on the other hand, were prepared to pay $30 or $40 per figure. Simply put, when people can call something their own, they feel more connected to it and thus value it much more.

Next, we’ll look at the differences between internal and external motivators.
