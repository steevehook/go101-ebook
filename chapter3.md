# Chapter 3
## Working toward goals you can achieve is highly motivating.

Have you heard the Greek myth of Sisyphus? Sisyphus was a hubristic and crafty king, and the gods, dismayed at his deceit, decided to punish him. They condemned him to repeat an impossible task for all eternity: he must push a massive boulder up a hill – a boulder that, once it reached the top, always rolled back down.

Thankfully, we’re not all doomed to such a repetitious fate. In real life, we don’t have to toil forever toward unreachable goals. In fact, after spending some time performing a task that doesn’t seem to be leading anywhere, most of us will simply quit.

Just take an experiment the author performed with engineers. The engineers were told to build something out of Lego Bionicles – a style of Lego designed to create robots with a particular personality and backstory, kind of like comic book characters. Half the engineers were in love with the activity, while the rest couldn’t have cared less.

Once the engineers had completed the task, the author took all the completed robots and dismantled them in front of the engineers. He then asked the engineers to build another robot. After a few rounds like this, both groups of engineers, the ones who liked the project and the ones who hated it, simply gave up. They saw no meaning in the activity.

In contrast, performing an activity that offers a sense of achievement is extremely motivating. To prove it, the author performed the same experiment with a different group, also split between people who loved working with Legos and others who weren’t so enthusiastic.

This time, the author didn’t dismantle the robots. Instead, he simply asked them to build something else in addition to what they’d already built. While the engineers who didn’t like Legos stopped after a few rounds, the ones that loved the process kept going for much longer, but still eventually gave up. It just goes to show that, no matter how much you love something, you’ll stop doing it if your sense of achievement is removed.

So achievement is key to motivation. However, it’s not the only thing that motivates us. Next up, we’ll take a look at the other big drivers: ownership and effort.
